            <h2>Meet Shay</h2>
<p style="font-size: 1em;">I’ve spent 25 years in the IT industry — at Microsoft, Intel, in consulting, and with startups. I’ve seen how tech can make a real difference for businesses — and how often it gets overcomplicated by people who don’t listen and try to upsell things that aren’t needed. IT shouldn’t be that hard. My job is to fix what’s broken, keep things simple, and give you straight answers without the jargon.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1em;">I’ve worked with business owners who just want things to work — not to sit through a pitch or get sold on a bunch of extras. I get that. I come from a trades background. I know what it means to work with your hands, manage jobs, and get things done efficiently. I speak your language, I show up, and I deliver work that’s solid and reliable. If you’ve got a tech problem, I’ll fix it. If there’s a better way to do something, I’ll show you. And if you just want things to stop being a pain, I can help with that too.</p>
